## Submission Instructions

### Overview
The aim of this project is to provide a fast and fun way to plan dinner by keeping track of the user's
groceries, and providing meal ideas based on those ingredients. The app will allow the user to track groceries by
entering in the items, which will be logged in a database. The user can then look up recipes from online databases with thousands of options,
and filter those results based on a number of diet and health parameters.
The idea came to me after going grocery shopping and coming home with a box of pasta just to find four boxes of the same pasta in my cupboard.
It was a waste of money and time. I think I should know what I have at home, even if I'm already in the store.

### Features
User login: Users will be able to create accounts and log in to the application. Each user will have a profile page.
Grocery List: Users will be able to retrieve, edit, and sort items entered into their personal kitchen inventory
Recipe Lookup: Users will be able to search a user generated recipe book. They also will be able to pull recipes from internet recipe databases through API integration and functions.
"Can I make it?" : Users wil be able to know if they have the necessary ingredients to complete a recipe, and if not, what they need to buy.

### Technologies
Java
MySQL
Gradle
Thymeleaf templates
Hibernate

### What I'll Have to Learn
I will have to learn how to merge branches with someone else and handle the bugs from that.
I will have to learn to pull from an API using REST as before we used fetch.
I will have to learn how to set up intellij completely from scratch as before the layout was already created.
